  abstract = {We present a new Python package, gwbench, implementing the well-established Fisher information formalism as a fast and straightforward tool for the purpose of gravitational-wave benchmarking, i.e. the estimation of signal-to-noise ratios and measurement errors of gravitational waves observed by a network of detectors. Such an infrastructure is necessary due to the high computational cost of Bayesian parameter estimation methods which renders them less effective for the scientific assessment of gravitational waveforms, detectors, and networks of detectors, especially when determining their effects on large populations of gravitational-wave sources spread throughout the universe. gwbench further gives quick access to detector locations and sensitivities, while including the effects of Earth's rotation on the latter, as well as waveform models and their derivatives, while giving access to the host of waveforms available in the LSC Algorithm Library. With the provided functionality, gwbench is relevant for a wide variety of applications in gravitational-wave astronomy such as waveform modeling, detector development, cosmology, and tests of general relativity.},

  abstract = {Monitoring of vibrational eigenmodes of an elastic body excited by gravitational waves was one of the first concepts proposed for the detection of gravitational waves. At laboratory scale, these experiments became known as resonant bar detectors first developed by Joseph Weber in the 1960s. Due to the dimensions of these bars, the targeted signal frequencies were in the kHz range. Weber also pointed out that monitoring of vibrations of Earth or the Moon could reveal gravitational waves in the mHz band. His Lunar Surface Gravimeter experiment deployed on the Moon by the Apollo 17 crew had a technical failure, which greatly reduced the science scope of the experiment. In this article, we revisit the idea and propose a Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA). We find that LGWA could become an important partner observatory for joint observations with the space-borne, laser-interferometric detector LISA and at the same time contribute an independent science case due to LGWA’s unique features. Technical challenges need to be overcome for the deployment of the experiment, and development of inertial vibration sensor technology lays out a future path for this exciting detector concept.},

  abstract = {We introduce \$\textbackslash texttt\{GWFAST\}\$, a novel Fisher-matrix code for gravitational-wave studies, tuned toward third-generation gravitational-wave detectors such as Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). We use it to perform a comprehensive study of the capabilities of ET alone, and of a network made by ET and two CE detectors, as well as to provide forecasts for the forthcoming O4 run of the LVK collaboration. We consider binary neutron stars, binary black holes and neutron star-black hole binaries, and compute basic metrics such as the distribution of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the accuracy in the reconstruction of various parameters (including distance, sky localization, masses, spins and, for neutron stars, tidal deformabilities), and the redshift distribution of the detections for different thresholds in SNR and different levels of accuracy in localization and distance measurement. We examine the expected distribution and properties of `golden events', with especially large values of the SNR. We also pay special attention to the dependence of the results on astrophysical uncertainties and on various technical details (such as choice of waveforms, or the threshold in SNR), and we compare with other Fisher codes in the literature. In a companion paper we discuss the technical aspects of the code. Together with this paper, we publicly release the code \$\textbackslash texttt\{GWFAST\}\$ at https://github.com/CosmoStatGW/gwfast, and the library \$\textbackslash texttt\{WF4Py\}\$ implementing state-of-the-art gravitational-wave waveforms in pure \$\textbackslash texttt\{Python\}\$ at https://github.com/CosmoStatGW/WF4Py.},

  abstract = {A Gravitational Wave Background (GWB) is expected in the universe from the superposition of a large number of unresolved astrophysical sources and phenomena in the early universe. Each component of the background (e.g., from primordial metric perturbations, binary neutron stars, milli-second pulsars etc.) has its own spectral shape. Many ongoing experiments aim to probe GWB at a variety of frequency bands. In the last two decades, using data from ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave (GW) observatories, upper limits on GWB were placed in the frequency range of 0∼ 50−100 Hz, considering one spectral shape at a time. However, one strong component can significantly enhance the estimated strength of another component. Hence, estimation of the amplitudes of the components with different spectral shapes should be done jointly. Here we propose a method for “component separation” of a statistically isotropic background, that can, for the first time, jointly estimate the amplitudes of many components and place upper limits. The method is rather straightforward and needs negligible amount of computation. It utilises the linear relationship between the measurements and the amplitudes of the actual components, alleviating the need for a sampling based method, e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or matched filtering, which are computationally intensive and cumbersome in a multi-dimensional parameter space. Using this formalism we could also study how many independent components can be separated using a given dataset from a network of current and upcoming ground based interferometric detectors.},
