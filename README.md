# Clean coding thesis

> Scientific software is often experimental and thus messy, 
> undocumented, not reusable. As a given piece of software grows 
> in user count, though, it can benefit in applying 
> development best practices which are well-known in the 
> industry setting.
> This thesis will discuss a selection of these practices and show
> their application for a `python` project named
> `GWFish`, a Fisher matrix code used for gravitational wave
> data analysis.

This thesis is written for the Galilean school of higher studies
(SGSS).
It is in Markdown, and it can be compiled to a PDF file with `pandoc`;
after cloning the repo just run 

```bash
make
```

All the code necessary to run the examples in the `Testing` and 
`Refactoring` chapters is contained in the `scripts/` folder.
